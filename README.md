# BIS Tech Challenge

## Overall Reflections
- This is a really fun challenge! I enjoyed working on both of these, and I plan to continue to reach full replication. 
- I wish I had a bit more time before the deadline, as I know I was very close to completing both (including deployment). 
- A great learning experience overall, one of which I would highly recommend to any of my fellow dev professionals.
